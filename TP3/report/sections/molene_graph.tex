\section{Molene temperature graph}

We will study the Molene data set (the one we used in the last tutorial).
The signal is the temperature.

\begin{exercise}
Construct the graph using the distance matrix and exponential smoothing (use the median heuristics for the bandwidth parameter). 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove all stations with missing values in the temperature.
    \item Choose the minimum threshold so that the network is connected and the average degree is at least 3.
    \item What is the time where the signal is the least smooth?
    \item What is the time where the signal is the smoothest?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The stations with missing values are:
ARZAL, BATZ, BEG\_MEIL, BREST-GUIPAVAS, BRIGNOGAN, CAMARET,
LANDIVISIAU, LANNAERO, LANVEOC, OUESSANT-STIFF,
PLOUAY-SA, PLOUDALMEZEAU, PLOUGONVELIN, QUIMPER,
RIEC-SUR-BELON, SIZUN, ST-NAZAIRE-MONTOIR, and VANNES-MEUCON.

The threshold is equal to 0.83 (using Lambert II étendu)

The least smooth signal occurs at 2014-01-10 09:00:00

The smoothest signal occurs at 2014-01-24 19:00:00
\end{solution}
