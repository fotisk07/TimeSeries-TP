\section{Molene temperature graph}

We study the Molene dataset using temperature signals.

\begin{exercise}
Construct the graph using distance-based exponential smoothing.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove stations with missing values.
    \item Choose the minimum threshold ensuring connectivity and average degree $\ge 3$.
    \item Identify the least smooth and smoothest timestamps.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The stations with missing values are \dots

The threshold is \dots

The least smooth signal occurs at \dots

The smoothest signal occurs at \dots
\end{solution}
