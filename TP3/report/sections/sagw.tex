\section{Wavelet transform for graph signals}
Let $G$ be a graph defined a set of $n$ nodes $V$ and a set of edges $E$. A specific node is denoted by $v$ and a specific edge, by $e$.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian $L$ are $\lambda_1\leq\lambda_2\leq\dots\leq \lambda_n$ and $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots, $u_n$ respectively.

For a signal $f\in\RR^{n}$, the Graph Wavelet Transform (GWT) of $f$ is $ W_f: \{1,\dots,M\}\times V \longrightarrow \RR$:
\begin{equation}
    W_f(m, v) := \sum_{l=1}^n \hat{g}_m(\lambda_l)\hat{f}_l u_l(v)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{f}= [\hat{f}_1,\dots,\hat{f}_n]$ is the Fourier transform of $f$ and $\hat{g}_m$ are $M$ kernel functions.
The number $M$ of scales is a user-defined parameter and is set to $M:=9$ in the following.
Several designs are available for the $\hat{g}_m$; here, we use the Spectrum Adapted Graph Wavelets (SAGW).
Formally, each kernel $\hat{g}_m$ is such that
\begin{equation}
    \hat{g}_m(\lambda) := \hat{g}^U(\lambda - am) \quad (0\leq\lambda\leq\lambda_n)
\end{equation}
where $a:=\lambda_n / (M+1-R)$,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{g}^U(\lambda) := \frac{1}{2}\left[ 1 + \cos\left( 2\pi\left(\frac{\lambda}{a R}  + \frac{1}{2} \right)\right) \right]\one(-Ra \leq \lambda < 0)
\end{equation}
and $R>0$ is defined by the user.

\begin{exercise}
Plot the kernel functions $\hat{g}_m$ for $R=1$, $R=3$ and $R=5$ (take $\lambda_n=12$) on Figure~\ref{fig:sagw-kernels}. What is the influence of $R$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The parameter \(R\) directly controls the spectral support of each kernel, which is
\[
\mathrm{supp}(\hat g_m) = [a_m - Ra,\, a_m).
\]
As \(R\) increases, the kernels become wider in the spectral domain, leading to stronger
overlap between adjacent scales and smoother frequency coverage.
Conversely, smaller values of \(R\) produce narrower kernels with reduced overlap,
resulting in a more localized and selective spectral tiling.
