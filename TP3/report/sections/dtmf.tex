\section{Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF)}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone\_multi-frequency\_signaling}{Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling} is a procedure to encode symbols using an audio signal.
The possible symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, *, \#, A, B, C, and D.
A symbol is represented by a sum of cosine waves: for $t=0,1,\dots, T-1$,

$$
y_t = \cos(2\pi f_1 t/f_s) + \cos(2\pi f_2 t/f_s)
$$
where each combination of $(f_1, f_2)$ represents a symbols.
The first frequency has four different levels (low frequencies), and the second frequency has four other levels (high frequencies); there are 16 possible combinations.
In the notebook, you can find an example symbol sequence encoded with sound and corrupted by noise (white noise and a distorted sound).

\begin{exercise}
Design a procedure that takes a sound signal as input and outputs the sequence of symbols. 
To that end, you can use the provided training set.
The signals have a varying number of symbols with a varying duration. 
There is a brief silence between each symbol.

Describe in 5 to 10 lines your methodology and the calibration procedure (give the hyperparameter values). Hint: use the time-frequency representation of the signals, apply a change-point detection algorithm to find the starts and ends of the symbols and silences, and then classify each segment.
